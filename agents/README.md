## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

3. Configure API credentials:
   - Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
     ```
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
     GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
     FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
     INSTAGRAM_USERNAME=your_username
     INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD=your_password
     LINKEDIN_USERNAME=your_username
     LINKEDIN_PASSWORD=your_password
     MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=your_api_key
     HUBSPOT_API_KEY=your_api_key
     ```

## Usage

1. Data Collection:
   ```python
   from data_processor import DataProcessor
   
   processor = DataProcessor('config/data_collection_config.json')
   await processor.initialize()
   
   # Collect data from all sources
   data = await processor.collect_all_data(start_date, end_date)
   
   # Process and aggregate data
   processed_data = processor.process_data(data)
   ```

2. Analytics Dashboard:
   ```python
   from analytics_dashboard import AnalyticsDashboard
   
   dashboard = AnalyticsDashboard('config/analytics_config.json')
   dashboard.generate_insights(processed_data)
   dashboard.display()
   ```

## Intelligence System

### Case Study Analysis
- Implemented intelligent pattern recognition from successful case studies
- Analyzes patterns across content, timing, engagement, and audience metrics
- Uses machine learning for pattern identification and optimization
- Provides actionable recommendations based on successful patterns

### Performance Monitoring
- Automated daily metrics collection across all agents
- Weekly performance reports sent to gagan@designgaga.ca
- Intelligent benchmarking against successful case studies
- Prioritized action items based on performance gaps

### Key Features
- Pattern recognition across multiple dimensions:
  * Content optimization (post length, media usage, hashtags)
  * Timing optimization (posting schedule)
  * Engagement patterns (likes, comments, shares, saves)
  * Audience targeting (demographics, interests)
  * Conversion optimization (funnel metrics)
- Weekly email reports with:
  * Performance metrics vs benchmarks
  * Data-driven recommendations
  * Prioritized action items
  * Success pattern analysis

### Configuration
- Configurable success thresholds
- Customizable metrics and dimensions
- Flexible reporting schedule
- Email notification settings

## Security Considerations

- All API credentials are stored securely using environment variables
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Role-based access control
- IP whitelisting
- Comprehensive audit logging

## Performance Optimization

- Asynchronous data collection
- Efficient data storage using Parquet format
- Configurable batch sizes and concurrent requests
- Automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Data caching for frequently accessed metrics
